00:00.300 --> 00:00.690
OK.

00:00.720 --> 00:05.400
So before we jump in let's define what this course is and what it isn't.

00:05.400 --> 00:11.400
So we have a clear understanding of what we'll be getting out of it what it isn't is a how to draw or

00:11.490 --> 00:12.990
even necessarily how to paint.

00:12.990 --> 00:18.130
Course I'm not going to be going over really any of the structural part when it comes to the drawings.

00:18.200 --> 00:23.160
You expect that I already have a basic drawing understanding this is going to be about how to understand

00:23.160 --> 00:25.130
life and how to paint it accurately.

00:25.380 --> 00:33.890
So that being said if you don't know how to draw super Well I would recommend brushing up on that first.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.560
Or if you just want to learn some different lighting techniques that's fine too.

00:37.680 --> 00:41.960
But this won't really be covering my full process from drying to finish painting we're only going to

00:41.960 --> 00:44.370
be focusing on the lighting aspect of things.

00:44.370 --> 00:49.230
Secondly as far as painting goes I will be teaching you different painting techniques but this isn't

00:49.230 --> 00:50.670
going to be a beginning to end.

00:50.670 --> 00:54.370
Here's how I paint an image type of course.

00:54.420 --> 00:58.740
It's really mostly just focusing on all the different aspects of lighting.

00:58.780 --> 01:02.570
Now I don't think that means that it doesn't have a lot of content.

01:02.570 --> 01:06.800
There is much to cover when it comes to light and you'll definitely get your money's worth.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.820
So don't be worried about that but just know that it's not so much focusing on the drawing and even

01:11.900 --> 01:12.740
on the painting.

01:12.750 --> 01:16.840
But much more on the light itself.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.110
So keep that in mind.

01:19.110 --> 01:24.780
Also another thing that this course is not is it's not really a software tutorial course so I will be

01:24.780 --> 01:27.010
using pro-create for the iPad Pro.

01:27.120 --> 01:33.840
However the information I'm giving you is pretty software agnostic so that if you're using Photoshop

01:33.840 --> 01:39.390
or Krogh painter or sketchbook pro or whatever software you like to use or even if you're painting traditionally

01:39.750 --> 01:43.120
the information is very transferable.

01:43.320 --> 01:47.700
So I'm using pro-create you can use Photoshop and you'll be just fine.

01:47.700 --> 01:54.090
However I'm not going to be going into detail about how to use any of the specific programs I'm not

01:54.090 --> 01:56.380
going to be explaining how to use pro-create.

01:56.490 --> 02:02.550
I will go over various tips and stuff and layer modes and stuff like that but I'm not going to be going

02:02.550 --> 02:06.960
over every single tool and you're expected to have a basic knowledge of whatever software it is you

02:06.960 --> 02:08.190
plan to use.

02:08.190 --> 02:10.100
So keep that in mind as well.

02:10.470 --> 02:15.240
What this course is besides awesome is all about light and color.

02:15.240 --> 02:20.970
So what we will be covering is you know creating good color schemes understanding different types of

02:20.970 --> 02:26.410
lighting situations from you know sunlight overcast light electric light stuff like that.

02:26.910 --> 02:29.270
Understanding how life works.

02:29.310 --> 02:35.670
And you know how to paint light when it's coming from different directions how different surfaces react

02:35.670 --> 02:41.730
to light you know metal when light shines through leaves water or stuff like that.

02:41.790 --> 02:46.970
Those are all things we'll be talking about we were talking about value hue saturation Croma all of

02:46.970 --> 02:54.900
a thing so I just know that going in what you'll be getting out of it by the time you're finished you

02:54.900 --> 03:00.450
should be able to take your current level of art and totally bring it to the next level and understand

03:00.630 --> 03:01.520
the science of light.

03:01.530 --> 03:06.030
The theory behind it the techniques that you need to be able to paint your life accurately there will

03:06.030 --> 03:10.500
still be plenty of demo so that you can see how I do it and how I paint it.

03:11.010 --> 03:12.990
And you'll still be able to get a lot out of it.

03:13.020 --> 03:16.160
So don't let that discourage you.

03:16.200 --> 03:23.290
Even if you maybe aren't the best Drori draftsmen I would still recommend taking it.

03:23.280 --> 03:27.580
There's a lot that you can learn that will help you make your paintings a lot better just starting out

03:27.580 --> 03:29.070
by the time you do start painting a drawing.

03:29.070 --> 03:33.780
So that being said let's jump in and start painting our first thing.

03:33.810 --> 03:34.770
So you guys the next one.
